<h2>Homework Assignment</h2>
Finish the homework assignment of making your own fancy magic eight ball app on a web page. The user provides input, there is randomization and an answer/fortune is returned. 
<ul>
<li>Use Math.random to randomize choices</li>
<li>Store potential returns in an array</li>
<li>Functions and logic will need to be used</li>
<li>Use some degree of CSS to make the page look decent</li>
<li>COLLABORATE with your partner over Github</li>
<li>Whoever has the master on Github, submit the link over Slack</li>
<li>If one of you has access to your CUNY server space, post the page and send that link as well</li>
<li>Next week's class isn't until Thursday, and the assignment is due at <b>12:00am on Tuesday</b></li>
</ul>
