        <h1>JavaScript Time</h1>
        <hr>
        
        <p>Often times in our code we'll want to utilize time by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wanting to know what today (or any other day) is</li>
            <li>Wanting to have something execute at a certain time</li>
            <li>Wanting something to execute repeatedly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>JavaScript has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">date object</a> with a ton of different methods and parameters. You can get down the current time down to the nearest millisecond, set a date, and figure out elapsed time since your program has been running. All date functionality references January 1st, 1970, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Here is a bunch of date information we can get. Try typing them in the console.</p>     
     
            <pre>
            Date();
            Date.now();
            var today = new Date(Date());
            today.getDate();
            today.getDay();
            today.getFullYear();
            today.getHours();
            today.getMillliseconds();
            today.getMonth();
            today.getSeconds();
            today.getTime();
            var yesterday = new Date("Sun Mar 27 2016");
            </pre>

            <p>The latter was how to make a new date in our program that's not this exact second. You can right out dates a number of ways.</p> 

            <pre>
            var birthday = new Date('December 17, 1995 03:24:00');
            var birthday = new Date('1995-12-17T03:24:00');
            var birthday = new Date(1995, 11, 17);
            var birthday = new Date(1995, 11, 17, 3, 24, 0);
           </pre>

         <p>If we want to figure out the time elapsed since our program has run, based on date (and not the functions we'll learn about next, we just need to set a variable when the page loads, and then one when we need to figure out the current time.</p>
        
        
        <pre>
        // using Date objects
        var start = Date.now();

        // Something happens for a long time...
       
        var end = Date.now();
        var elapsed = end - start; // elapsed time in milliseconds
        </pre>
        
        <hr>
        <h3>setTimeout and setInterval</h3>
     
        <p>The date object is great, but sometimes what we need is much simpler than that. We can use <b>setTimeout</b> to execute a function at a certain time. Try this in the console:</p>
        
        <pre>
        function time () {
            alert ("Time!");
        }
        
        setTimeout(time, 3000);
        </pre>
        
        <p>We can also make something happen repeatedly with <b>setInterval</b>. If we simply change the time function from above, it'll happen every three seconds. </p>
        
        <pre>
        function timeAgain () {
            alert ("Time!");
        }
        
        setInterval(timeAgain, 3000);
        </pre>
        
        <p>If we want to clear either the timeout or the interval, we assign it to a variable, and clearTimeout or clearInterval:</p>
        
        <pre>
        function timeAgain () {
            alert ("Time!");
        }
        
        var theInt = setInterval(timeAgain, 3000);
        
        function timeUp () {
            clearInterval(theInt);
        }
        
        setTimeout(timeUp, 10000);
        
        </pre>
        
        <p><b>Note:</b> The alert we're using here pauses time as long as it's up.</p>
        
        <p>In class assignment: make a birthday countdown, similar to this <a href="http://www.xmasclock.com/">Christmas countdown</a>. The user should type in their birthday, and it'll show how long until their birthday.</p>
